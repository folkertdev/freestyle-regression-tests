freestyle-regression-tests
==========================

Series of regression tests for Blender's Freestyle stylized edge renderer, mainly aimed at Python-defined types

To use you need to:

- have imagemagick installed and in the path
- adjust config.py to point to valid folders and/or files
- verify that regression_style_module.py points to valid folders (in the cProfile part at the bottom) 

This is developed with Python 3.4 but should work with 3.2 and higher
